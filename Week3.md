# Weekly Report: Keep myselfed Challenged and Informed

## Thoughts on watching Design in Tech Report from 2017

In the report, I found insightful observations about the evolving landscape of design in the technology industry. It highlighted a significant shift from "tech-led" to "experience-led" design, largely driven by the widespread adoption of mobile devices and the increasing demand for consumer-friendly computing. This transition has not only reshaped the way we approach design but also sparked a surge in venture capital interest in design-focused ventures and acquisitions of design agencies by consulting firms.

One key takeaway from the report is the emphasis on the pivotal role of computational design in driving growth and innovation. It underscores the importance of inclusive cultures within tech businesses, emphasizing that design is not merely about aesthetics but a strategic component for maintaining market relevance and achieving meaningful outcomes.

In summary, the Design in Tech Report from 2017 reaffirms that Computational Design is a critical field in today's tech industry, merging technology with design principles to create impactful digital experiences. Key themes include collaboration, user-centered design, and the strategic role of design in shaping the industry's dynamic nature.
