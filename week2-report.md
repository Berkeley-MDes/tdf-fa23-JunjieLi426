# Learning Journey Reflection
In this repository, I document my learning journey as I explore and master the Grasshopper software. This tool is crucial in my field, and I aim to document my progress and insights along the way.
## Weekly Reflection

Throughout the past week, I dedicated significant time to watching a tutorial video. While the video itself was only an hour long, I invested nearly three hours practicing the concepts on my computer. This experience highlighted the paramount importance of post-class practice, especially given my initial unfamiliarity with the software. I found myself repeatedly rewinding and fast-forwarding sections of the video, often watching specific clips multiple times to ensure a comprehensive understanding. It's worth noting that this video has proven immensely beneficial to my learning journey, and I deeply appreciate the resource.
