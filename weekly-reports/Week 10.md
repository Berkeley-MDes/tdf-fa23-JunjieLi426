## Reflections

This week's highlight was the insightful presentation by Leila Madrone, a tech innovator with a focus on renewable energy and innovative technology. Her discussion on Sunfolding and the potential of solar power tracking systems was eye-opening. I learned about Sankey Flow diagrams, which are valuable tools for visualizing the flow of resources and quantities within a system. These diagrams serve multiple purposes, such as data visualization, resource tracking, and decision support. This newfound knowledge is bound to influence my work as a UX designer, as it provides a fresh perspective on how to communicate complex data and resource flows to users.

Leila's speech also emphasized the importance of collaboration between designers and engineers. I reflected on how designers often prioritize the user's perspective, while engineers might lean towards data interaction over human-computer interaction. This distinction in mindset presents opportunities for more effective collaboration in our work.

## Speculations

Looking ahead, I speculate that the field of renewable energy and sustainable technology is poised for significant growth and innovation. Leila's work at Sunfolding and the broader industry trends suggest that the development of green technology will continue to play a pivotal role in addressing climate change and environmental sustainability. As a UX designer, I foresee opportunities to contribute to the design of user-friendly interfaces for these evolving technologies, making them more accessible and engaging for consumers.

Regarding Sunfolding and solar tracking systems, the future seems promising. With advancements in technology and increased awareness of the need for renewable energy sources, solar power tracking solutions are likely to become more efficient and widely adopted. This could have a substantial impact on reducing our carbon footprint and making solar energy more accessible.

In terms of collaboration between designers and engineers, it's essential to acknowledge the ongoing evolution of this partnership. As technology continues to advance rapidly, designers and engineers must find new ways to align their perspectives and work seamlessly to create products that balance both user-centric and data-centric needs. This collaboration will play a vital role in shaping the future of technology and user experience.

## Inspiration

During my exploration of industry publications, I came across an interesting article in a renowned tech magazine that discusses the latest advancements in green technology. The article highlighted a breakthrough in energy storage systems that could revolutionize the way we harness and utilize renewable energy. The concept of using advanced materials and innovative designs to store energy more efficiently is intriguing, and it aligns with the broader trend of pushing the boundaries of sustainable technology. You can read the article [here](insert link) and share it with your peers for further discussion.

In conclusion, this week's report is a reflection on the knowledge gained from Leila Madrone's presentation, speculation on the future of sustainable technology and UX design, and a bonus piece of information that could shape our understanding of the industry. These insights are invaluable for staying at the forefront of our rapidly evolving field.

Whether it is engineering design, there is also a design process. Maybe as an interaction designer, I pay more attention to users, but engineering design cares more about the product itself. I hope that I can have more knowledge and better cross-domain cooperation in the future.
