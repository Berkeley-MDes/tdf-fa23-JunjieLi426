# **1: Understand the proposal and create tasks to implement it**

Creating a system that generates poems based on gyroscope data involves combining elements of hardware (gyroscope sensors) and software (AI for poem generation).

## Hardware Setup:

Gyroscope Sensor: Connect a gyroscope sensor to a microcontroller (such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi). Gyroscope sensors measure the rate of rotation around a particular axis.

Data Processing: Use the microcontroller to read data from the gyroscope sensor. The data should include information about the speed, direction, and distance of movement.

**Software Development:**

Interfacing with Gyroscope Data:

Write code to interpret the gyroscope data. For example, fast movement in a specific direction could be mapped to high emotional intensity, while slow movement might represent calmness.

Define a range of values for speed, direction, and distance that correspond to different emotional states.

**Poem Generation Algorithm:**

Develop or use a poem generation algorithm. You can use pre-existing natural language processing (NLP) models, such as GPT-3, to generate poems.

Integrate the poem generation algorithm with the gyroscope data interpretation. Map the emotional states to parameters that influence the style, tone, and content of the generated poems.

**Feedback Loop:**

Create a feedback loop to continuously adjust the poem generation based on the real-time gyroscope data.

Experiment with different mapping functions to find the most intuitive and expressive relationship between gyroscope data and poem characteristics.

**Output:**

Design a way to output the generated poems. This could be through a display, speakers, or any other suitable output medium.

### Research on how to design on the sensor

Speed:

Fast Movement: Use fast speed to represent intense emotions. This could result in poems with dynamic language, rapid pacing, and energetic themes.

Slow Movement: Associate slow speed with calm or reflective emotions, leading to poems with a relaxed pace, gentle language, and contemplative themes.

Direction:

Forward Movement: Connect forward direction with positive emotions, resulting in optimistic and hopeful poems.

Backward Movement: Associate backward direction with negative emotions, leading to poems with darker themes or challenging situations.

Circular Movement: Use circular movement to convey a sense of continuity or cycles in emotions, resulting in poems that explore recurring themes.

Distance:

Short Distance: Relate short distances to proximity or intimacy, inspiring poems with personal and close connections.

Long Distance: Connect long distances with separation or longing, influencing poems with themes of distance, nostalgia, or desire.

Combined Parameters:

High Speed + Forward Direction: Combine high speed with forward movement to represent excitement or passion, resulting in poems with enthusiastic and forward-looking content.

Slow Speed + Circular Movement: Combine slow speed with circular movement to convey a contemplative, cyclic emotion, inspiring poems that explore repetitive or meditative themes.

Intensity:

Use a combination of speed, direction, and distance to determine emotional intensity. Higher intensity could lead to poems with stronger language, vivid imagery, and heightened emotional expression.

Rhythm and Meter:

Adjust the rhythm and meter of the poems based on the gyroscope data. For example, fast and irregular movements could result in free verse or more experimental poetic forms, while slow and steady movements might influence a regular meter.

Rhyme Scheme:

Connect certain gyroscope patterns to specific rhyme schemes. For instance, consistent and repetitive movements could correspond to poems with a regular rhyme scheme, while unpredictable movements might lead to poems with irregular or no rhyme.

Inspired by "THE INSTALLATION," where collective poems are formed from crowdsourced data, our project speculates on the formation of collective narratives through user interactions. The integration of gyroscope data may contribute to a unique narrative synthesis.

Drawing from the NLP algorithms used in this installation, our speculation involves the application of similar techniques to stitch together phrases from gyroscope inputs. This could result in the creation of poetic expressions influenced by physical movements.

Inspired by "Text Rain," our project speculates on users actively shaping the poetic output. Much like viewers catching falling letters in "Text Rain," our users may manipulate the poetry generated in real-time through their gyroscope-driven movements. This installtion emphasis on the interaction loop between users and technology resonates with our speculation. The gyroscope, serving as a sensor for physical actions, aligns with the concept of a dynamic interaction loop, where poetry responds to users' movements.

I'm also thinking about what our display format should be like. I've done some research and I hope to use [mad mapper](https://madmapper.com/) to create special-shaped projections.

# Reflection

Reflection on the Final Project Journey
As I reflect on the journey of our final project, it's incredible to see the transformation from a conceptual idea to a tangible fusion of technology and art. The overarching goal of creating a system that generates poems based on gyroscope data has led us through a multi-faceted exploration encompassing hardware, software, and interactive design. Let's delve into key aspects of the project journey.

1. Understanding the Proposal and Task Implementation
The inception of the project involved a meticulous breakdown of tasks bridging hardware and software components. The integration of gyroscope sensors with microcontrollers set the foundation for collecting data on movement speed, direction, and distance. The software development phase focused on interpreting this data and creating a seamless connection with a poem generation algorithm. The concept of a feedback loop aimed at refining the poem generation process in real-time added a layer of complexity to the development.

2. Drawing Inspiration from Design Work
Our project drew inspiration from existing installations such as "THE INSTALLATION" and "Text Rain." These works informed our speculation on creating collective narratives through user interactions. The application of NLP algorithms and the dynamic interaction loop between users and technology played a crucial role in shaping our vision. The users actively shaping the poetic output through gyroscope-driven movements echoed the spirit of engagement seen in "Text Rain."

3. Research on Installation Form
The consideration of display format involved research into special-shaped projections using tools like MadMapper. This step emphasized the importance of how our project would visually manifest in a physical space, aligning with the overarching theme of user interaction and engagement.

4. Field Research and Space Design
Physical space considerations became paramount as we measured the dimensions of the room and made practical purchases like shade cloth. This step demonstrated the project's transition from a theoretical concept to a tangible, real-world implementation.

5. Creation of ZeroWidth Knowledge Base
Classifying poems, testing, and observing AI-generated poems formed a crucial part of our project's development. This phase allowed us to fine-tune the AI model and understand how gyroscope data influenced the characteristics of the generated poems.

6. Gyroscope Sensor Gloves Design
The exploration of innovative designs, such as the Mi.Mu glove and Texture Palette, added a layer of creativity to our project. The inspiration from these designs influenced the development of our own gyroscope sensor gloves, showcasing the intersection of technology and artistic expression.

In conclusion, the final project journey has been a dynamic and enriching experience. It involved navigating through the intricacies of hardware and software integration, drawing inspiration from existing works, and actively considering the physical manifestation of our project in a designated space. The continuous loop of ideation, implementation, and refinement has resulted in a project that not only generates poems based on gyroscope data but also engages users in a unique and interactive artistic experience.
