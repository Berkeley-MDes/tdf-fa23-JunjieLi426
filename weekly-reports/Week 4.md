### Project 1 Recap

This week, we successfully wrapped up Project 1, and it's time to take a moment to reflect on our accomplishments. We achieved the following key milestones:

It was a fantastic journey, and I'm proud of the design process I made without Grasshopper experience before

Establishing the Base Shape:

Begin by creating a flat surface that will serve as the base of the mobile phone holder. This base will be the foundation for your design.
Use Grasshopper's geometry creation tools to define this flat surface.
Dividing the Holder into Parts:

To structure the phone holder, divide it conceptually into two main parts: a large triangle and a smaller triangle. These will form the basic elements of your design.
Utilize Grasshopper's geometric operations to create these triangular shapes.
Transformation into 3D:

Transition from 2D to 3D by extruding or lofting the two triangles to give them volume. This step turns them into solid objects rather than flat shapes.
Leverage Grasshopper's geometry transformation components for this process.
Assembly Using Boolean Operations:

Combine the two volumetric triangles to create the final shape of the phone holder. This can be achieved through Boolean operations, such as union or intersection.
Implement Grasshopper's Boolean components to assemble the parts seamlessly.
Slider for Adjustments:

Enhance the functionality of your phone holder by adding sliders in Grasshopper.
These sliders allow you to dynamically adjust key parameters such as height, width, and tilt, giving you real-time control over the design.
Use Grasshopper's slider components to achieve this level of customization.

### Lessons Learned

Throughout Project 1, we encountered various challenges and learned important lessons:

- [Grasshopper, as a parametric design tool, was a revelation. It allowed me to turn my ideas into tangible 3D models efficiently. Creating the foundation, breaking down the design into components, and adding dimension to them were made incredibly smooth through Grasshopper's capabilities. The ability to transition from 2D sketches to 3D objects was nothing short of magical.
]

These lessons will undoubtedly benefit us in future projects.


### Goals for Next Week _porject2

Looking ahead to next week, our primary goals for Project 2 preparation are:

- [learn the what is photon 2:The Photon 2 is a development module with a microcontroller and Wi-Fi networking. The form-factor is similar to the Argon (Adafruit Feather), but the Photon 2 supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi, BLE, and has much larger RAM and flash that can support larger applications.]
- [follow the tutorial]

I'm excited to see where Project 2 takes us and am confident that we'll build on our successes from Project 1.

Let's keep up the great work!
