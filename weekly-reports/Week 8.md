# Weekly Report - Water Synthesizer Project

## Reflections

This week was marked by significant progress in our Water Synthesizer project. As a team, we focused on designing the floor plan of the water container. We utilized Adobe Illustrator to create the blueprint, which was then realized by cutting acrylic sheets with a laser cutter. After assembling the pieces using super glue, we conducted a test. However, we encountered an issue during the test â€“ the container was not properly glued and sealed, leading to leakage. This situation prompted us to engage in troubleshooting and repair work.

One of the key takeaways from this experience was the importance of precision and attention to detail in the manufacturing process. It reinforced the idea that even a minor flaw in the construction can have a significant impact on the final product's functionality. Our understanding of the importance of proper sealing and construction techniques was enhanced through hands-on learning.

In terms of the state of our work, we've made considerable headway in the physical construction of the water container. This progress signifies a positive step forward in the overall development of our Water Synthesizer project.

## Speculations

Looking ahead, it's clear that our Water Synthesizer project holds immense potential. With an innovative approach to music creation, utilizing water and touch sensitivity, we believe we are transforming the music learning experience into an engaging and immersive journey. The future direction for the tools and hardware involved in this project is exciting. We speculate that the integration of gesture recognition and the addition of visual feedback will further enhance the interactive and sensory aspects of our instrument. This aligns with the broader trend of technology in music, and we believe it will contribute to advancing the way people engage with musical instruments.

Furthermore, in the realm of human experiences, we anticipate the Water Synthesizer to make music more inclusive. It will enable individuals, regardless of their musical background or abilities, to create and enjoy music in a unique way. This project exemplifies the powerful combination of technology and artistic expression.

From an engineering perspective, our project involves the integration of various fields, including technology, human-computer interaction, mechanical engineering, and acoustic engineering. We foresee that our work will have a significant impact on the development of innovative musical instruments that break the traditional mold.

## Reading

In a recent industry publication, we came across an article that highlighted a groundbreaking development in the field of interactive musical instruments. The article discussed a project where musicians could control and manipulate sound using wearable devices and body movements. The concept was not only intriguing but also highly relevant to our work on the Water Synthesizer. It provided insights into the evolving landscape of interactive music and how technology is shaping new possibilities.

This source is a valuable reference that we plan to explore further, and it offers potential inspiration for enhancing our project.

In conclusion, this week's report reflects on our progress, speculates on the future direction of our Water Synthesizer project, and shares an interesting industry publication that aligns with our goals. We are excited about the journey ahead and look forward to the continued development of our innovative musical instrument.

We are almost done for the final video yeah!
