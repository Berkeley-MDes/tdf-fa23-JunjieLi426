# **Proposal Version1Interactive Water-Based Musical Instrument**

**Introduction:**

We propose an immersive way of transforming the steep process of learning music into a fun filled experience! It will be an innovative interactive hardware project that combines water, touch sensitivity, and gesture recognition to create a unique musical experience. Colorful trigger objects and various sets of hand motion in water results in production of musical patterns that can not only make learning music fun, but also a wholesome experience to the audience.

Through this project , we aim to explore various facets of music, culture, and interactivity through a multi-sensory experience.

**Background:**

Music ignites all areas of child development and skills, including intellectual, social-emotional, motor, language, and overall literacy. It helps the body and the mind work together. Exposing children to music during early development helps them learn the sounds and meanings of words.

**Target Audience:**

This project can be enjoyed by people of all ages but will be most beneficial for kids in their early developmental phase.

**Project Details:**

**A. Water-Based Musical Instruments:**

One core aspect of the project involves creating a set of musical instruments with different rhythms. Each instrument corresponds to a container of water, and individuals can interact with these containers to produce music. This setup encourages people to explore the musical potential of water as a medium, fostering creativity and engagement.

**B. Gesture Recognition for Musical Control:**

To enhance the interactivity, we will implement gesture recognition. Users can perform specific hand gestures within the water to control various aspects of the music. For instance, clockwise hand movements can increase the volume, while counterclockwise movements can decrease it. These gesture-based controls add an extra layer of engagement and playability to the musical experience.

**C. Integration of Visual Feedback:**

To further enrich the user experience, we will integrate visual feedback through projection. When users interact with the water and perform gestures, a projection system will create animations, ripples, color changes, and other visual effects on the water's surface. This visual feedback will provide an immersive and captivating experience, enhancing the connection between the users and the music they create.

**Modular Approach:**

The project's modular nature allows us to combine and expand upon these ideas based on project intensity and time management. This flexibility ensures that we can adapt the project to meet various objectives and resource constraints.

**Cultural Significance:**

The project's speculative aspect is to use ethnic music as a foundation. We aim to package this interactive musical experience as a platform for people to explore the music of different cultures. By transforming well-known melodies into international music experiences, we can bridge cultural gaps and promote musical diversity. This approach aligns with the broader goal of celebrating global cultural heritage through technology and creativity.

**Materials:**

Particle Photon 2 Developer Kit: It's the core of your hardware setup and will control the sensors, gesture recognition, sound generation, and communication.

Conductivity Sensor: For detecting changes in water conductivity or moisture. You can use sensors like capacitive touch sensors or specific water conductivity sensors.

Containers for Water: You'll need containers to hold water, each corresponding to a different musical instrument. These containers can be made of various materials such as plastic, glass, or acrylic, depending on your project's aesthetics.

Gesture Recognition Sensors: Depending on the complexity of your gesture recognition system, you might need components like accelerometers, gyroscopes, or IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors to detect hand movements and gestures in the water.

Speakers or Sound Modules: To generate and amplify sounds. You can use small speakers, piezoelectric transducers, or dedicated sound modules for higher audio quality.

Projection System (Optional): If you plan to integrate visual feedback through projection, you'll need a projector and a screen or a surface for projection.

Power Supply: You'll need a power source, such as a battery pack or a power adapter, to provide power to the Photon 2 and other components.

LEDs (Optional): LEDs can be used for visual feedback or to enhance the visual aspect of your project. For example, you can use RGB LEDs to change colors based on user interactions.

Enclosures or Housings: Depending on your project's design, you may want to enclose the components in a protective housing to ensure they are safe and presentable.

Cables and Connectors: Various types of cables (e.g., USB cables, jumper wires) and connectors to connect the components together.

Materials for Visual Effects (Optional): If you plan to create animations, ripples, or other visual effects on the water's surface using projection, you may need materials like diffusers or projection screens.

Computers and Development Tools: You'll need a computer with the Particle development environment installed to program and control the Photon 2 board.

Materials for Cultural Significance: If you plan to incorporate elements of different cultures into your project, you'll need access to resources related to those cultures, such as music samples, artwork, and information.

### **Reading and reflection**

****This week we found a inspiration from this web

[https://mannlab.com/hydraulophone#:~:text=The hydraulophone is the world's,rich%2C unique%2C soulful sound](https://mannlab.com/hydraulophone#:~:text=The%20hydraulophone%20is%20the%20world's,rich%2C%20unique%2C%20soulful%20sound).

The hydraulophone serves as a great source of inspiration for our project, the "Interactive Water-Based Musical Instrument." It shares several key aspects that directly relate to our concept:

First and foremost, like the hydraulophone, our project revolves around creating musical sounds through interactions with water. The hydraulophone achieves this by touching small jets of water, and our concept involves water containers and gestures to produce musical patterns. This shared focus on water as a musical medium makes the hydraulophone a significant source of inspiration for our project.

Additionally, the hydraulophone challenges the traditional categorization of musical instruments by introducing a new category based on the liquid state of matter. In a similar vein, our project seeks to expand the possibilities of interactive and immersive music by introducing water-based musical instruments. Both concepts challenge conventional notions of musical instruments, broadening the scope of possibilities for creating and enjoying music.

The idea of carefully crafting and sculpting hydraulophones for underwater and above-water use also resonates with our project. It underscores the adaptability and versatility of water-based musical instruments for various settings and environments, which aligns with our project's vision.

Furthermore, the hydraulophone's therapeutic applications in patient's homes, retirement homes, and nursing homes parallel our project's potential benefits, particularly for early childhood development. It highlights the broader positive impact of using water-based musical instruments, not just for entertainment but also for enhancing well-being and therapy.

Finally, the concept of the "balnaphone," derived from the Ancient Greek word "balnea" for bath, captures the immersive and unique nature of water-based music. In our project, the user's interaction with water and the integration of visual feedback create an immersive experience that can be likened to the idea of a balnaphone.

In essence, the hydraulophone provides a real-world example of how musical instruments can be designed and used with water as a central element. It offers insights into the creative, interactive, and therapeutic potential of water-based music, which directly informs our project's design and objectives. It underscores the innovative and holistic nature of water-based music experiences that we aim to create.
