### Project Update
#### Designing the Water Container
- We used Adobe AI to design the floor plan.
- Acrylic sheets were cut using a laser and assembled into the container with super glue.
- An issue was discovered during testing as the container was not sealed properly, leading to leakage. We successfully repaired it.

#### Preparing for the Final Stage
- We've defined the introduction of our project, highlighting its innovative and immersive nature.
- Our goal remains to create an interactive hardware-based musical instrument utilizing water and touch sensitivity to craft a unique musical experience.
